MediBot represents a significant advancement in AI-powered medical assistance, successfully integrating machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and computer vision to deliver reliable health insights. Developed using Visual Studio, the project leverages a FAISS vector store constructed from The Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine, with embeddings generated by Hugging Face’s sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2, and employs the meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct vision model via Groq for image analysis and Mistral-7B-Instruct a 7-billion-parameter Hugging Face model for processing text queries and generating accurate medical responses.

 The Streamlit front-end, enhanced with voice input (via Google’s speech recognition) and audio output (via gTTS), provides an intuitive interface, while the RetrievalQA back-end ensures accurate responses validated by source documents. MediBot’s ability to handle text queries and medical images has been rigorously tested, demonstrating its efficacy for educational and preliminary health assistance purposes.

While not a substitute for professional diagnosis, MediBot’s transparent, user-friendly design and robust performance make it a valuable tool for students, educators, and individuals seeking accessible medical information, marking a promising step toward AI-driven healthcare solutions.
